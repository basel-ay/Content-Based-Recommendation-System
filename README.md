# Content-Based-Recommendation-System

**What is a Recommendation System?**

Simply put a Recommendation System is a filtration program whose prime goal is to predict the “rating” or “preference” of a user towards a domain-specific item or item. In our case, this domain-specific item is a movie, therefore the main focus of our recommendation system is to filter and predict only those movies which a user would prefer given some data about the user him or herself.

**Content-Based Filtering** 

suggest similar items based on a particular item. This system uses item metadata, such as genre, director, description, actors, etc. for movies, to make these recommendations. The general idea behind these recommender systems is that if a person likes a particular item, he or she will also like an item that is similar to it. And to recommend that, it will make use of the user's past item metadata. A good example could be YouTube, where based on your history, it suggests you new videos that you could potentially watch.
